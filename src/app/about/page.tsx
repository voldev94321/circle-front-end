          We&apos;re thrilled to introduce you to our platform. This marks an
          exciting milestone as we unveil Circle, a next-generation SocialFi
          platform designed to transform how you engage with social media and
          finance. Our journey began as a simple insight: existing platforms
          lacked the seamless integration of social interaction with financial
          opportunities. We saw a gap and decided to fill it with Circleâ€“a
          platform that caters to tech needs of both crypto enthusiasts and
          everyday users alike. Imagine a world where your social interactions
          seamlessly intersect with financial possibilities. With Circle, you
          can access robust feature reminiscent of platforms you&apos;re familiar
          with while effortlessly engaging in financial transactions. Whether
          you&apos;re a content creator looking to earn fair compensation or a user
          seeking a vibrant community to connect with, Circle has something for
          everyone.<br/><br/> 
          But our vision goes beyond features and functionalities. At
          Circle, we&apos;re committed to prioritizing your security and privacy.
          Built on Cardano&apos;s blockchain, our platform ensures that your data and
          transactions are safeguarded at every turn.<br/><br/> Join us as we embark on
          this journey to redefine this intersection of social engagement and
          financial empowerment. We&apos;re just getting started, and we can&apos;t wait
          to share our exciting updates, new features, and platform with you.<br/><br/>
          Together, let&apos;s build something extraordinary. <br/><br/>Jordan Moore, Founder &
          CEO
